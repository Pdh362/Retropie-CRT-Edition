| Current Version  | BETA 2.5.1  | [Changelog](https://github.com/krahsdevil/crt-for-retropie/wiki/Changelogs)  |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|

Adding support to Retropie 4.4 for custom 15khz resolutions and some cool utilities like USB Automount or easy TATE mode changing.

This software works with RGB-Pi and all standard (RGB) vga666 GPIO adapters (or based on like pi2scart).
Boot, configure controls on ES and go to 'Screen Utilies' under 'CRT Config' for choosing your adapter (RGB-Pi > VGA666 > PI2SCART)

Maybe some professional monitors like SONY PVM, BVM or DTV could face some resolution problems, most of TV or monitors seems to work great with super-resolutions.

You can find original RGB-Pi project for recalbox [here](https://github.com/mortaca/RGB-Pi/)
