Adding support to Retropie for custom 15khz resolutions and some cool utilities like USB Automount or easy TATE mode changing.

This software works with all standard (RGB) vga666 GPIO adapters (or based on like pi2scart) and some custom adapters like RGB-Pi.
Boot, configure controls on ES and go to 'Screen Utilies' under 'CRT Config' for choosing your adapter (VGA666 > RGB-Pi > PI2SCART)

Maybe some professional monitors like SONY PVM, BVM or DTV could face some resolution problems, most of TV or monitors seems to work great with super-resolutions.
